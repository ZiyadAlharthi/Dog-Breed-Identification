# Dog Breed Classification

## Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to identify the breed of a dog given an image. Utilizing deep learning techniques, the project aims to classify images into one of 120 different dog breeds.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is derived from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition. It consists of over 10,000 labeled images for training and an equal number of unlabeled images for testing.

You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data).

The dataset features are:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| id | Unique identifier for each image |
| breed | Breed of the dog (one of 120 classes) |

## Tools
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- seaborn

## Algorithms
The project employs the following deep learning techniques:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Transfer Learning with pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the machine learning models will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## Evaluation Method
The evaluation will consist of generating prediction probabilities for each dog breed in the test dataset, comparing these predictions against the actual labels to assess model performance.
